## Presentation
My research activities lie at the interface of **mathematical modelling**,
**mechanobiology**, and **numerical simulation**.
In particular, I am interested in the modelling of biological systems
as complex, dynamic entities whose behaviour and morphology are
constantly evolving.
This evolution is governed by biophysical interactions, including
mechanical and biochemical processes, making biological systems both
exciting and challenging subjects of study.
The main goal of my research has thus been to develop biophysically
grounded mathematical models capable of capturing the interplay between
mechanics and biochemistry in **evolving geometries**, as well as
**computational methods** to study the response and output of such models.

## Research interests
- Modelling of mechanical and biochemical processes using
 partial differential equations
- Evolving geometries
- Finite element methods
- Bio-inspired design generation

## Modelling philosophy
One of the drawbacks of *in silico* models is the lack of
**interpretability of results**.
By definition, a model is a simplified description of the reality.
In addition, biological measures needed to fit model parameters vary
strongly from one case to another and in many situations are not
available.
In response, my research is not focused on reproducing specific
experimental systems quantitatively, but rather it focuses on using
**mathematical modelling** as a **computational comparative tool**.
Thus, my work relies on the **systematic parameter exploration**,
supported by the definition of **objective metrics**, to investigate
linear and nonlinear relations.

## Current research
I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at **Université Côte d’Azur**
in the **Laboratoire Jean Alexandre Dieudonné** working under the
supervision of **Rachele Allena** and **Frédéric Luton** and in
collaboration with **Anotida Madzvamuse**.

My current research focuses on the interaction between
**tumour cells** and the **basement membrane**, a thin yet stiff
extracellular matrix that plays a central role in tissue organisation
and cancer invasion.
Modelling this interaction requires the coupling of mechanics and
biochemistry within highly deformable and evolving domains.
Using **geometric-surface partial differential equations**, I
investigate how tumour cells breach the basement membrane using
protease-independent mechanisms, particularly through filopodial
activity.

abstract: "Synovial joints are known by their resistance to wear as they can withstand millions of load cycles. Such performance is attributed to the development process where joints are adapted to the loading environment. In engineering applications, wear is frequently a cause of failure. Classical joint design usually leads to uneven pressure distribution, accelerating wear in concentrated regions. In this work, we use a bio-inspired design methodology to generate contact interfaces. The key point of this methodology is the use of the growth rules of synovial joint during development. Specifically, hydrostatic stress promotes growth and high shear stress inhibits it. We apply these rules in an iterative algorithm to generate contact interfaces adapted to the loading environment. We present a case study to generate the shape of body in frictionless contact with an elastic half space using the bio-inspired approach. We compare the pressure and wear distribution between the bio-inspired and classical designs. The results highlight that the bio-inspired methodology produces almost uniform contact pressure and wear distribution, in contrast to the concentration inherent in classical designs. Thus, this study accentuates the potential advantages of this bio-inspired methodology, offering a compelling avenue for achieving high-performance contact interfaces."

abstract: "Additive manufacturing facilitates the materialization of complex designs, e.g. bio-inspired non-assembly joints. Despite the advantages of this type of joints, such as single-step manufacturing, their performance under operational conditions remains poorly understood. This paper explores the design, fabrication and wear performance of a hinge-type joint inspired by the camel elbow. The joint was fabricated by metal additive manufacturing and its wear behaviour was numerically and experimentally evaluated. The results show that the bio-inspired design performs better than a cylindrical one in terms of wear distribution. This work helps to better understand the wear performance of non-assembled bio-inspired joints."
